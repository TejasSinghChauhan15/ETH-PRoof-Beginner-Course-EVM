# ETH-PRoof-Beginner-Course-EVM

Description
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple ERC-20-like token using Solidity. The MyToken contract allows users to mint and burn tokens, providing a basic understanding of token management on the Ethereum blockchain. This project is ideal for beginners looking to get hands-on experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity programming.

Getting Started
Executing program

To run this program, you will need to have a Solidity development environment set up. Follow these steps to get started:

1- Install Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
"sudo apt install nodejs npm"

2- Install Truffle: Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum.
"npm install -g truffle"

3- Create a new Truffle project: Initialize a new Truffle project.
"mkdir MyTokenProject
cd MyTokenProject
truffle init"

4- Write the Solidity contract: Create a new file MyToken.sol in the contracts directory and paste the provided Solidity code.


5- Compile the contract: Compile the Solidity contract using Truffle.
"truffle compile"

6- Deploy the contract: Deploy the contract to a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache).
"truffle migrate"

7- Interact with the contract: Use Truffle console to interact with the deployed contract
"truffle console"
